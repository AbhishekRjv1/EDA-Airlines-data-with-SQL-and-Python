# EDA-with-SQL-and-Python

## Flight Occupancy Data Analysis:

## Objective
The objective of this data analysis project is to identify opportunities for increasing the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, ultimately boosting profitability for the airline. The analysis utilizes SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database and performs various calculations and visualizations to gain insights into flight occupancy rates, revenue, and passenger bookings.

## Technologies Used
- SQLite: For database management and querying.
- Python Libraries:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
 
## Instructions for Use
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have SQLite and the required Python libraries installed.
   - Place the `travel.sqlite` database file in the same directory as the Python script.

2. **Running the Code:**
   - Execute the provided SQL queries and Python code in the specified order.
   - Review the outputs, visualizations, and calculations generated by the code.
   - Interpret the results to gain insights into flight occupancy rates and revenue trends.

## Data Exploration
The analysis starts by exploring the database, including tables such as `aircrafts_data`, `airports_data`, `boarding_passes`, `bookings`, `flights`, `seats`, `ticket_flights`, and `tickets`. Information from these tables is extracted and processed for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning
The code checks for missing values in each table, ensuring data quality and integrity. Missing values, if any, are identified and reported.

## Basic Analysis
1. **Planes with More Than 100 Seats:**
   Determines the aircraft codes and counts of planes with more than 100 seats, providing insights into larger planes' availability.

2. **Booking Trends Over Time:**
   Analyzes the number of tickets booked over time, displaying a trend graph to visualize booking patterns. Additionally, it examines changes in total earnings based on booking dates, providing revenue insights.

3. **Average Charges by Aircraft and Fare Conditions:**
   Calculates and visualizes the average charges for each aircraft under different fare conditions, offering a comparative analysis.

## Occupancy Rate Analysis
1. **Total and Average Revenue per Aircraft:**
   Calculates the total revenue per year and the average revenue per ticket for each aircraft, providing a financial overview of different aircraft.

2. **Average Occupancy Rate per Aircraft:**
   Computes the average occupancy rate for each aircraft, taking into account the booked seats and total available seats.

3. **Projected Increase in Annual Turnover:**
   Simulates a 10% increase in occupancy rates for all aircraft, estimating the potential rise in the total annual turnover based on the adjusted occupancy rates.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into flight occupancy rates and revenue trends, enabling strategic decisions to increase profitability. By understanding booking patterns, fare conditions, and occupancy rates, the airline can optimize its operations and enhance its financial performance.
